# Encounters

Encounter cards are events that occur to the hero as they adventure
in the dungeon.

## Types

There are different encounter types:

### Merchant

The floor's merchant is available for everyone.
THe merchant's stock is refreshed.

See **The Merchant**.

### Portal

The final boss is available to fight at any time for those who have a **Portal Key**.

See **Bosses**.

### Combat

A round of combat begins.
See **Combat** for rules.

### Elite Combat

Same as combat, but the monsters are given a passive benefit.
The hero is rewarded 1 gold for each monster defeated.

### Non-Combat

The hero is given a choice of 3 actions.
The spirits each choose 1 of the actions, shown by a die (face 1-3).
This is done in secret.
The hero then makes their choice.
Each spirit, if any, that chose the same action as the hero gains
1 **Wrath** and activates 1 instance of **Bad Stuff** for that choice.

## Floor

Every floor is composed of 1 merchant, 1 portal, and 10 random encounter cards.
Shuffle these face down.

At the start of the turn, the hero draws an encounter card face up and resolves it.
Once all the floor cards are drawn, draw 10 new encounter cards and shuffle
them with the merchant and portal cards for the next floor.
Everyone can now spend their wrath before adventuring into the next floor.
